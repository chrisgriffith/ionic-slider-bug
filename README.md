Sample Repo for Ionic Slider issue

##Issue
The home page has a simple 3 slide slider. The button on each slide will change the page to a details screen. If you navigate back to the home screen using the header navigation, the slider will function again. If you use the ion button to go back (via this.navCtrl.push(HomePage), the slider will NOT function.
